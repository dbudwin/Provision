# Provision

This is just a GitHub repo for me to keep track of files I use to provision my computers, like aliases I like to use to make my time in the console more productive.

* To find the correct `.gitconfig` file to add the contents of `GitConfigAliases.txt` to, execute `git config --list --show-origin`.
* Add the contents of `BashAliases.txt` to `~/.bashrc`
